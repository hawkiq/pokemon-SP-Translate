## Game Description

Pokémon Shining Pearl is a role-playing video game developed by ILCA and published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. Released in November 2021, it is a remake of the original Pokémon Pearl, which debuted on the Nintendo DS in 2006. Players embark on a thrilling adventure in the Sinnoh region, capturing and training Pokémon, battling other trainers, and striving to become the Pokémon Champion. With enhanced graphics, quality-of-life improvements, and a nostalgic storyline, Shining Pearl aims to bring the classic experience to both new players and returning fans.

## Why We Translate to Arabic

As passionate fans of the Pokémon franchise, we recognize the growing community of Arabic-speaking players who deserve access to this beloved game in their native language. Translating Pokémon Shining Pearl into Arabic not only helps bridge the language gap but also allows more players to fully immerse themselves in the game's rich world and narrative. By providing an Arabic translation, we hope to foster inclusivity and enhance the gaming experience for Arabic-speaking audiences.
